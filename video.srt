the variable $HOME is root for my laptop

create a virtual environment for python 3 on the home folder

and it is created.

by the source command can be used with python and pip command for just this folder.

let's install flask with the just one line command

it is done


and create a python file then edit with nano

the first: import flask from flask

app equals flask name


app dot route... slash


make a definite function the line below the app route class

and function return should be string like this.

save and...

run the script

with python...

done nothing because we don't call app run like this.


and again


default port number is 5-0-0-0

let's see


you can see.

even we edit the source code. it will be nothing

sh script is running with the first code..

should be restarted to see changes.
